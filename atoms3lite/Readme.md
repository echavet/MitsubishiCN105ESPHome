# atoms3 configuration example 
this directory contains an example of a tested configuration firmware for controling a Mitsubishi cooling unit via CN105.
Please note that, as an example too, this config includes the bt-proxy. This allows me to control my Gardena Irrigation Vane thanks to its proximity to the unit.
