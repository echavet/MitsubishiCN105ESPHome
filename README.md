# Mitsubishi CN105 ESPHome

> [!WARNING]  
> Due to a change in ESPHome 2025.2.0, some users are reporting build problems related to the loading of the `uptime_seconds_sensor` class. If you get a compile error for this reason, manually add an uptime sensor to your YAML configuration as below, clean your build files, and recompile. Once the root cause is identified this note will be removed.

This project is a firmware for ESP32 microcontrollers supporting UART communication via the CN105 Mitsubishi connector. Its purpose is to enable complete control of a compatible Mitsubishi heat pump through Home Assistant, a web interface, or any MQTT client.

It uses the ESPHome framework and is compatible with the Arduino framework and ESP-IDF.

This component version is an adaptation of [geoffdavis's esphome-mitsubishiheatpump](https://github.com/geoffdavis/esphome-mitsubishiheatpump). Its purpose is to integrate the Mitsubishi heat pump protocol (enabled by the [SwiCago library](https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump)) directly into the ESPHome component classes for a more seamless integration.

The intended use case is for owners of a Mitsubishi Electric heat pump or air conditioner that includes a CN105 communication port to directly control their air handler or indoor unit using local communication through a web browser, or most commonly, the [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) home automation platform. Installation requires the use of a WiFi capable ESP32 or ESP8266 device, modified to include a 5 pin plug to connect to the heat pump indoor unit. ESPHome is used to load the custom firmware onto the device, and the web browser or HomeAssistant software is used to send temperature setpoints, external temperature references, and settings to the heat pump. Installation requires basic soldering skills, and basic skills in flashing a firmware to a microcontroller (though ESPHome makes this as painless as possible).

The benefits include fully local control over your heat pump system, without reliance on a vendor network. Additional visibility, finer control, and even improved energy efficiency and comfort are possible when utilizing the remote temperature features.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use at your own risk.
> This is an unofficial implementation of the reverse-engineered Mitsubishi protocol based on the Swicago library. The authors and contributors have extensively tested this firmware across several similar implementations and forks. However, it's important to note that not all units support every feature. While free to use, it is at your own risk. If you are seeking an officially supported method to remotely control your Mitsubishi device via WiFi, a commercial solution is available [here](https://www.mitsubishi-electric.co.nz/wifi/).

### New Features

- Support Fahrenheit users better by mapping unit conversions to Mitsubishi's "creative" math, ensuring that HomeAssistant and external thermostats stay in sync. Thanks [@ams2990](https://github.com/ams2990) and [@dsstewa](https://github.com/dsstewa)!
- Additional components for supported units: vane orientation (fully supporting the Swicago map), compressor frequency for energy monitoring, and i-see sensor.
- Additional diagnostic sensors for understanding the behavior of the indoor units while in AUTO mode.
- Additional sensors for power usage and outdoor temperature (not supported by all units).
- Code is divided into distinct concerns for better readability.
- Extensive logging for easier troubleshooting and development.
- Ongoing refactoring to further improve the code quality.
- Enhanced UART communication with the Heatpump to eliminate delays in the ESPHome loop(), which was a limitation of the original [SwiCago library](https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump).
- Byte-by-byte reading within the loop() function ensures no data loss or lag, as the component continuously reads without blocking ESPHome.
- UART writes are followed by non-blocking reads. The responses are accumulated byte-by-byte in the loop() method and processed when complete, allowing command stacking without delays for a more responsive UI.

### Retained Features

This project maintains all functionalities of the original [geoffdavis](https://github.com/geoffdavis/esphome-mitsubishiheatpump) project, including:

- Wireless Mitsubishi Comfort HVAC equipment control via ESP8266 or ESP32, using the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) framework.
- Instant feedback of command changes via RF Remote to HomeAssistant or MQTT.
- Direct control independent of the remote.
- A slightly modified version of the [SwiCago/HeatPump](https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump) Arduino library for direct communication via the internal `CN105` connector.
- Full mode and vane orientation support (added as an extra component within the Core Climate Component).
- Thermostat in HomeAssistant with compressor frequency monitoring (an extra component within the Core Climate Component).

## Requirements

- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) - Minimum version 1.18.0, installed independently or as an add-on in HomeAssistant

## Supported Microcontrollers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ESP8266 boards such as the WeMos D1 Mini clones (LOLIN in particular) tend to be unreliable in this application, and may require an external voltage regulator to work. While some users have successfully used ESP8266 based devices, if you are purchasing new hardware for use with this project, it is recommended to focus on the more modern and powerful ESP32-S3 based devices.

- Generic ESP32 Dev Kit (ESP32): tested
- M5Stack ATOM Lite : tested
- M5Stack ATOM S3 Lite: tested w/ [modifications](https://github.com/echavet/MitsubishiCN105ESPHome/discussions/83)
- M5Stack StampS3
- Seeed Studios Xiao ESP32S3: tested
- WeMos D1 Mini Pro (ESP8266): tested (but not currently recommended, see above)

## Supported Mitsubishi Climate Units

Generally, indoor units with a `CN105` header are compatible. Refer to the [HeatPump wiki](https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump/wiki/Supported-models) for a comprehensive list. Additionally, Mitsubishi units listed as compatible with the [Mitsubishi PAC-USWHS002-WF-2 Kumo Cloud interface](https://mylinkdrive.com/USA/Controls/kumo_cloud/kumo_cloud_Devices/PAC_USWHS002_WF_2?product) will _likely_ be compatible with this project, as they use the same CN105 connector and serial protocol.

Units tested by project contributors include:

- `MSZ-SF50VE3`
- `MSZ-SF35VE3`
- `MSZ-GLxxNA`
- `MSZ-AP20VGK` (https://github.com/echavet/MitsubishiCN105ESPHome/discussions/83)
- `MSZ-AP42VGK`
- `MSZ-AP35VGD2` (https://github.com/echavet/MitsubishiCN105ESPHome/discussions/254)
- `MSZ-AY35VGKP`
- `MSZ-FSxxNA`
- `MSZ-FHxxNA`

## Usage

### Step 1: Building the Control Circuit

Follow the [SwiCago/HeatPump README](https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump/blob/master/README.md#demo-circuit) for building a control circuit using either an ESP8266 or ESP32.

### Step 2: Using ESPHome

Add a new device in your ESPHome dashboard. Create a yaml configuration file for the new device using the templates below, and flash to your device. Refer to the ESPHome documentation for guides on how to install ESPHome, add new devices, and flash the initial firmware.

- [Getting Started with ESPHome and HomeAssistant](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio)
- [Installing ESPHome Locally](https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome)

> [!NOTE]
> This code uses the ESPHome [external components](https://esphome.io/components/external_components.html) integration feature. This means the project is not part of the ESPHome framework, it is an external component not managed by the core ESPHome project.

### Step 3: Configure the board and UART settings

Your ESPHome device configuration file starts with common defaults for ESPHome. To these defaults, add these minimum sections:

#### For ESP32-based Devices

```yaml
esp32:
  board: esp32doit-devkit-v1 #or esp32-s3-devkitc-1
  framework:
    type: esp-idf

uart:
  id: HP_UART
  baud_rate: 2400
  tx_pin: GPIO17
  rx_pin: GPIO16
```

#### For ESP8266-based Devices

```yaml
esp8266:
  board: d1_mini

uart:
  id: HP_UART
  baud_rate: 2400
  tx_pin: 1
  rx_pin: 3
```

### Step 4: Configure the climate component

Add these sections to load the external component, setup logging, and enable the climate entity.

```yaml
# External component reference
external_components:
  - source: github://echavet/MitsubishiCN105ESPHome

# Climate entity configuration
climate:
  - platform: cn105
    id: hp
    name: "My Heat Pump"
    update_interval: 2s # update interval can be adjusted after a first run and logs monitoring

# Default logging level
logger:
  #  hardware_uart: UART1 # Uncomment on ESP8266 devices
  level: INFO
```

#### Adjusting the `update_interval`

An ESPHome firmware implements the esphome::Component interface to be integrated into the Inversion Of Control mechanism of the ESPHome framework.
The main method of this process is the `loop()` method. MitsubishiCN105ESPHome performs a series of exchanges with the heat pump through a cycle. This cycle is timed, and its duration is displayed in the logs, provided the `CYCLE` logger is set to at least `INFO`.

If this is the case, you will see logs in the form:

```
[09:48:36][I][CYCLE:052]: 6: Cycle ended in 1.2 seconds (with timeout?: NO)
```

This will give you a good idea of your microcontroller's performance in completing an entire cycle. It is unnecessary to set the `update_interval` below this value.
In this example, setting an `update_interval` to 1500ms could be a fine tuned value.

### Step 5: Optional components and variables

These optional additional configurations add customization and additional capabilities. The examples below assume you have added a substitutions component to your configuration file to allow for easy renaming, and that you have added a `secrets.yaml` file to your ESPHome configuration to hide private variables like your random API keys, OTA passwords, and Wifi passwords.

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: heatpump-1 # Do not use underscores, which are not fully compatible with mDNS
  friendly_name: My Heatpump 1
```

#### Climate component full example

This example adds support for configuring the temperature steps, adding an icon, and the optional climate sensors supported by SwiCago (but not supported by all indoor units), `compressor_frequency_sensor`, `vertical_vane_select`, `horizontal_vane_select` and `isee_sensor`. Supports many of the other features of the [ESPHome climate component](https://esphome.io/components/climate/index.html) as well for additional customization.

The `remote_temperature_timeout` setting allows the unit to revert back to the internal temperature measurement if it does not receive an update in the specified time range (highly recommended if using remote temperature updates).

`debounce_delay` adds a small delay to the command processing to account for some HomeAssistant buttons that may send repeat commands too quickly. A shorter value creates a more responsive UI, a longer value protects against repeat commands. (See https://github.com/echavet/MitsubishiCN105ESPHome/issues/21)

`fahrenheit_compatibility` improves compatibility with HomeAssistant installations using Fahrenheit units. Mitsubishi uses a custom lookup table to convert F to C which doesn't correspond to the actual math in all cases. This can result in external thermostats and HomeAssistant "disagreeing" on what the current setpoint is. Setting this value to `true` forces the component to use the same lookup tables, resulting in more consistent display of setpoints. Recommended for Fahrenheit users. (See https://github.com/echavet/MitsubishiCN105ESPHome/pull/298.)

`use_as_operating_fallback` in the `stage_sensor` is an uncommon option. If your unit doesn't accurately update the activity indicator (idle/heating/cooling/etc.), then this sensor can use the `stage_sensor` as an alternate source of information on the status of the unit. Not recommended for most users. (See https://github.com/echavet/MitsubishiCN105ESPHome/issues/277)

```yaml

      disabled_by_default: true
    runtime_hours_sensor:
      name: Runtime Hours
      entity_category: diagnostic
      disabled_by_default: true
```

> [!TIP]
> An `update_interval` between 1s and 4s is recommended, because the underlying process divides this into three separate requests which need time to complete. If some updates get "missed" from your heatpump, consider making this interval longer.

#### Logger granularity

This firmware supports detailed log granularity for troubleshooting. Below is the full list of logger components and recommended defaults.

```yaml
logger:
  # hardware_uart: UART1 # Uncomment on ESP8266 devices
  level: INFO
  logs:

```

### Step 6: Build the project and install

Build the project in ESPHome and install to your device. Install the device in your indoor unit connected to the CN105 port, and confirm that it powers up and connects to the Wifi. Visit the local IP address of the device, and confirm that you can change modes and temperature setpoints. HomeAssistant should now include a climate entity for your heatpump.

## Example Configuration - Minimal

This minimal configuration includes the basic components necessary for the firmware to operate. Note that you need to choose between the ESP32 and the ESP8266 sections to get the correct UART configuration. Utilizes a `secrets.yaml` file to store your credentials.

## Example Configuration - Complete

This example includes all the bells and whistles, optional components, remote temperature sensing, reboot button, and additional sensors in HomeAssistant including uptime, the current wifi SSID, and signal strength. Note that you need to choose between the ESP32 and the ESP8266 sections to get the correct UART configuration. Utilizes a `secrets.yaml` file to store your credentials. Comment out or remote features your unit doesn't support (such as the isee sensor or horizontal vane). It doesn't hurt to try them, but if your unit doesn't support that feature then it will be inactive.

## Methods for updating external temperature

There are several methods for updating the unit with an remote temperature value. This replaces the heat pump's internal temperature measurement with an external temperature measurement as the Mitsubishi wireless thermostats do, allowing you to more precisely control room comfort and improve energy efficiency by increasing cycle length.

### Recommended - Get external temperature from a [HomeAssistant Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/homeassistant.html) through the HomeAssistant API

Creates the sensor used to receive the remote temperature from Home Assistant. Uses sensor selected in substitutions area at top of config or manually entered into the sensor configuration. When the HomeAssistant sensor updates, it will send the new value to the ESP device, which will update the heatpump's remote temperature value.

Customize the filters to your application:

- Uncomment the first line to convert F to C when remote temps are sent.
- If you have a fast or noisy sensor, consider some of the other filter options such as throttle_average.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    name: "Remote Temperature Sensor"
    entity_id: ${remote_temp_sensor} # Replace with your HomeAssistant remote sensor entity id, or include in substitutions
    internal: false
    disabled_by_default: true
    device_class: temperature
    state_class: measurement
    unit_of_measurement: "°C"
    filters:
      # Uncomment the lambda line to convert F to C on incoming temperature
      #  - lambda: return (x - 32) * (5.0/9.0);
      - clamp: # Limits values to range accepted by Mitsubishi units
          min_value: 1
          max_value: 40
          ignore_out_of_range: true
      - throttle: 30s
    on_value:
      then:
        - logger.log:
            level: INFO
            format: "Remote temperature received from HA: %.1f C"
            args: ["x"]
        - lambda: "id(hp).set_remote_temperature(x);"
```

### Alternate - Get external temperature from a networked sensor with a throttle filter

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: pvvx_mithermometer
    mac_address: "A4:C1:38:XX:XX:XX"
    temperature:
      name: Thermometer

      filters:
        throttle_average: 90s

### Alternate - HomeAssistant Action

This example extends to default `api:` component to add a `set_remote_temperature` action that can be called from within HomeAssistant, allowing you to send a remote temperature value to the heat pump. You will need to include an automation in HomeAssistant to periodically call the action and update the temperature with `set_remote_temperature`, or disable remote temperature with `use_internal_temperature`. No longer recommended as the default method of updating remote temperature.

```yaml
api:
  encryption:
    key: !secret api_key
  services:
    - service: set_remote_temperature
      variables:
        temperature: float
      then:
        # Select between the C version and the F version
        # Uncomment just ONE of the below lines. The top receives the temperature value in C,
        # the bottom receives the value in F, converting to C here.
        - lambda: "id(hp).set_remote_temperature(temperature);"
    #        - lambda: 'id(hp).set_remote_temperature((temperature - 32.0) * (5.0 / 9.0));'
    - service: use_internal_temperature
      then:
        - lambda: "id(hp).set_remote_temperature(0);"
```

## Diagnostic Sensors

### Outside Air Temperature

This sensor reads the outdoor unit's air temperature reading, in 1.0 degree C increments. Not all outdoor units support this sensor. Some outdoor units will send an accurate value while the unit is operating, or in heat/cool mode, but will send -63.5C when offline.

```yaml
outside_air_temperature_sensor:
  name: Outside Air Temperature
```

Compatible units (as reported by users):

| Indoor         | Outdoor          | Temperature                        |

### Auto and Stage Sensors

The below sensors were added recently based on the work of others in sorting out other messages and bytes. The names are likely to change as we work to determine exactly what the units are doing.

```yaml
stage_sensor:
  name: Stage Sensor
sub_mode_sensor:
  name: Sub Mode Sensor
auto_sub_mode_sensor:
  name: Auto Sub Mode Sensor
```

- `stage_sensor` is the actual fan speed of the indoor unit. This is called stage in some documentation. Reported speeds include `IDLE`, `LOW`, `GENTLE`, `MEDIUM`, `MODERATE`, `HIGH` and `DIFFUSE`, named using Mitsubishi documentation conventions.

- `auto_sub_mode_sensor` indicates what actual mode the unit is in when in AUTO. Modes are `AUTO_OFF`, meaning AUTO is disabled, `AUTO_COOL`, meaning AUTO and cooling, `AUTO_HEAT`, meaning AUTO and heating and `AUTO_LEADER`, meaning this unit is the leader in a multi-head unit and selects the heat/cool mode that the others follow.

- `sub_mode_sensor` indicates additional detail on the current behavior of the unit. The Sub Modes are:
  - `NORMAL` - the unit is in an active mode (heat, cool, dry, etc.) and is either running, or waiting to run
  - `PREHEAT` - a cold-climate feature that electrically preheats the compressor windings prior to start of operation
  - `DEFROST` - a cold climate behavior that runs a short AC cycle during heating mode to melt ice from the coils
  - `STANDBY` - unit is off, or has been put into a "sleep" state through AUTO operation on another indoor unit

Some examples of how these all fit together: Unit 1 is in AUTO set to 20C and Unit 2 is in AUTO and set to 20C. Unit 1 senses that the room is 24C and tries to enter `AUTO_COOL`. If Unit 2 wants to heat the room it is in, it will enter `STANDBY` (and in the case of a few units tested, this mean it will go to "sleep" as if it is off, but not really be off) making Unit 1 enter `AUTO_LEADER` sub mode. In future releases, it is planned to make the ACTION in HA match these modes. But at this time this is not implemented.

It is also important to note that the Kumo adapter has many more settings that impact the behaviour above (such as thermal fan behaviour) and if you have set these the exact actions the untis take in these modes/submodes/stages is determined by those. Some of these can also be set by remotes and other devices. The setup you have will dictate the exact actions you see. If you have permutations, please share!

### UART Diagnostic Sensors

The following ESPHome sensors will not be needed by most users, but can be helpful in diagnosting problems with UART connectivity. Only implement if you are currently troubleshooting or developing new functionality.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    name: "dg_uart_connected"
    entity_category: DIAGNOSTIC
    lambda: |-
      return (bool) id(hp).isUARTConnected_;
    update_interval: 30s
  - platform: template
    name: "dg_complete_cycles"
    entity_category: DIAGNOSTIC
    accuracy_decimals: 0
    lambda: |-
      return (unsigned long) id(hp).nbCompleteCycles_;
    update_interval: 60s
  - platform: template
    name: "dg_total_cycles"
    accuracy_decimals: 0
    entity_category: DIAGNOSTIC
    lambda: |-
      return (unsigned long) id(hp).nbCycles_;
    update_interval: 60s
  - platform: template
    name: "dg_nb_hp_connections"
    accuracy_decimals: 0
    entity_category: DIAGNOSTIC
    lambda: |-
      return (unsigned int) id(hp).nbHeatpumpConnections_;
    update_interval: 60s
  - platform: template
    name: "dg_complete_cycles_percent"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    accuracy_decimals: 1
    entity_category: DIAGNOSTIC
    lambda: |-
      unsigned long nbCompleteCycles = id(hp).nbCompleteCycles_;
      unsigned long nbCycles = id(hp).nbCycles_;
      if (nbCycles == 0) {
        return 0.0;
      }
      return (float) nbCompleteCycles / nbCycles * 100.0;
    update_interval: 60s
```

## Other Implementations

- [esphome-mitsubishiheatpump](https://github.com/geoffdavis/esphome-mitsubishiheatpump) - The original esphome project from which this one is forked.
- [gysmo38/mitsubishi2MQTT](https://github.com/gysmo38/mitsubishi2MQTT) - Direct MQTT controls, robust but with a less stable WiFi stack.
- ESPHome's built-in [Mitsubishi](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/blob/dev/esphome/components/mitsubishi/mitsubishi.h) climate component - Uses IR Remote commands, lacks bi-directional communication.

## Dual UART Support: Heatpump and Melcloud Adapter (Proxy Mode)

This firmware now supports using two UARTs simultaneously: one for the Mitsubishi heatpump (CN105) and one for a Melcloud adapter (see [esphome-ecodan-hp](https://github.com/gekkekoe/esphome-ecodan-hp)).

**Proxy Mode:**

The ESPHome device acts as a transparent proxy between the heatpump and the Melcloud adapter. All communication between the Melcloud adapter and the heatpump is passed through this device, allowing you to monitor, log, or inject commands as needed. This enables advanced integrations and diagnostics, while maintaining compatibility with both systems.

### Example ESPHome YAML Configuration

```yaml
uart:
  - id: HP_UART
    baud_rate: 2400
    tx_pin: GPIO17
    rx_pin: GPIO16
  - id: MELCLOUD_UART
    baud_rate: 2400
    tx_pin: GPIO21
    rx_pin: GPIO22

climate:
  - platform: cn105
    id: hp
    name: "My Heat Pump"
    update_interval: 2s
    uart_id: HP_UART
    melcloud_uart_id: MELCLOUD_UART  # New: specify the Melcloud UART here
```

- `uart_id` is used for the main CN105/heatpump connection.
- `melcloud_uart_id` is used for the Melcloud adapter connection.

> [!NOTE]
> The Melcloud UART is optional. If not specified, only the heatpump UART will be used as before.
> In proxy mode, the ESPHome device transparently passes all data between the heatpump and Melcloud adapter, and can also monitor or log this traffic.

For more information on the Melcloud protocol and compatible adapters, see [esphome-ecodan-hp](https://github.com/gekkekoe/esphome-ecodan-hp).
